# Back End Final Project

## Description
This project will be a culmination of skills from 3 Junior Back End Developers. One of us will be almost completely dedicated to Andriod. In the end we hope to build an app that allows parents to build a system to incentivize their children to do more work around the house.

## What We are working On:
* Entities
	* Objects and their Relationships
* CRUD
	* Parents can Register.
	* Parents can register their children.
	* Parents can assign chores/tasks.
	* Children can mark a task complete.
